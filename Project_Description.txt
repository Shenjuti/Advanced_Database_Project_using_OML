Regarding the COVID Dataset
-----------------------------
The dataset has been collected from the Directorate General of Health Services, Bangladesh.
The dataset has 626 rows and 4 columns.
The dataset contains the number of COVID tests performed, number of persons tested positive and number of death cases for each day.

Term Project
-------------
As a term project, you will build a Machine Learning Model of one of the following types.
1. Regression Model
2. Classification Model 
3. Clustering Model
4. Time-Series Forcasting Model 

You must implement at least one algorithm of your chosen model using OML (Oracle Machine Learning). 
Implementing multiple algorithms is definitely a plus and it would be also easier to compare the performances of different algorithms.

At the end, you need to write a report based on the given template and need to present your work (12 minutes presentation). 
During the presentation, your cam must be switched on and each member in a group must participate in the presentation. 
Not participating/attending presentation would incur serious penalty. 

The date and time of the presentation will be notified in due course.
